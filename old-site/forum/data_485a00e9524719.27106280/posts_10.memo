-1                                                                                                          2      Determining a new policy for graduate student GSIâ€™s can seem complicated and utterly confusing, bu3      t we can simplify it down to a tradeoff between take-home-pay and GSI requirements.  The only soluti4      on that would avoid this tradeoff is to pay all students (not just fellowship students) additional p5      ay when they GSI.  This solution, however, may not be fiscally possible nor an acceptable solution t6      o the faculty, so we must consider a compromise to determine how to proceed.

      The first requ7      irement, take-home-pay, is the average yearly salary (GSI, GSR, fellowship, bonus, etc) a grad stude8      nt receives over 5 years.

      The second requirement, graduation requirements, is a little broa9      der in scope and includes the number of times a student must GSI, the percent appointment, when they10      will GSI, etc.

      The two extreme cases are: fixing GSI requirements and letting pay vary or 11     fixing pay and letting GSI requirements vary.  For example, the department could require everyone to12      GSI according to the current schedule and the pay would vary depending on whether or not the studen13     t is on fellowship tenure.  Alternatively, the department could control the pay by altering the GSI 14     requirements for graduation.

Points brought up for each scheme:

Equalizing requirements, varyi15     ng pay:

* Simple implementation.
* Guaranteed 2-term GSIship.
* Up to $16,000 discrepancy betwe16     en fellowship/non fellowship student.
* Discrepancies between students on same fellowship, based on17      luck of the draw.
	
Equalizing pay, varying requirements

* Reduced pay differences between stu18     dents
* Students on fellowship may not be able to GSI twice
* More complex implementation.    
* 19     Discrepancy in teaching experience based on fellowship status.    


      The current proposal f20     rom the faculty attempts to strike a balance between both of these variables and tended to the side 21     of equalizing take-home-pay.  Most of the students at the meeting, however, preferred equal graduati22     on requirements.  Once a decision has been made about which variable is most important, the details 23     of how to frame the solution can be negotiated to fulfill the overall objective of the majority of s24     tudents.

      Regardless of what you, the students, decide, we will use the following criteria t25     o guide the development of a new policy: competitiveness, fairness, and simplicity.  We must ensure 26     our department remains competitive and of high quality.  At the same time, we should ensure that pay27      is awarded in a manner that encourages students to apply for fellowships and pays based on fellowsh28     ip status rather than the timing of GSI appointments.  Furthermore, the new policy should be simple 29     to understand, as this helps with recruiting and accurate pay, and easy to implement because Rocioâ€-1     ™s job is hard enough.
