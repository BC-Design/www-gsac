-1                                                                                                          2      I am a new student and haven't had a chance to use the BART much but will need to use it to get to t3      he airport in a couple of weeks. Does the BART run 24 hrs a day, and if so, is it a good and safe id-1     ea to use it at, say, 4AM? Any other general information that I should know about the BART? Thanks! 5      The BART does not run 24 h/day.  It stops running around midnight.  You can check out the times at b6      art.gov.  I think, in general, the bart is pretty safe, even at 4am.  It's also usually on time, so 7      you can rely on the website for times.  The cost for BART depends on the distance of your trip, and 8      if you are coming from oakland, you will need to take the airbart to get from the airport to the nea9      rest bart station, which is $3.

Be sure to save your ticket because you will need it to leave the B-1     ART.                                                                                                11     For getting to/coming back from SFO, check potential flight plans on

I did some quick click throughs though, and the breakdowns are (as of summer 2008)--
Arrivals to 13     SFO:
Earliest possible-- 5:30am during the week, 7:07am on Sat, 9:15am on Sun
Latest possible-- 1:3014     am every day

Departures from SFO:
Earliest possible-- 4am during the week, 6am on Sat, 8am on Sun
L15     atest possible-- 11:53pm every day

That said, some things to note--
*flying into/out of Oakland air16     port is worth looking in to.  Oakland airport is also accessible by public transportation via Bart a17     nd short shuttle ride, $3 exact change, on AirBart.

In the event that something goes awry, it's easy to get someone to pick you up since19      Oakland is fairly close.  As transportation to/from there too depends on Bart, your time frame is s20     imilar, but you get the comfort of having better back-up options (i.e., ride from friend, bus, cheap21     er taxi).

*when booking a flight back to Berkeley, try to come back in the afternoon/evening.  When22      coming from the midwest/east coast, 3 hr delays are common enough that you may get stuck at SFO for23      the night.

*super shuttle (1-800-Blue-Van) operates at all hours and so you can ride from SFO to B24     erkeley for $35~$40.  If you follow the above two points though, you should hopefully be ok, but it'25     s an easy enough number to remember just in case.

Regarding early morning safety, anything in walki26     ng distance to the North Berkeley or Downtown Berkeley Bart station should be alright.  You can ask -1     around about the other stations if you end up living closer to some of the others.                  -1     Penny totally out did my previous post.

[url]http://parents.berkeley.edu/advice/map.html[/url]                          -1     Where do I go to get a $30 street parking permit for the year? Thanks                               34     Not sure where this belongs, but curious about how this is usually handled. Since prelims are in Jan35     uary, go first years generally come back right after Christmas or New Years, or does it depend on th36     e individual/his or her adviser? Its a long way off but I'm trying to get plane tickets as early as -1     possible...                                                                                         38     Generally, first years come back about 2 weeks before the exam to study.  That puts it right around 39     new years.  I came back just before new years, but several people in  my class came back later.  I g40     uess, ultimately, it depends on what you want to do over the break and how long you think you will n41     eed to study.

Advisers don't typically ask first years to do any research before the prelim exam, s-1     o as long as you are here for the exam, that should be fine.                                        43     A good description of the street parking permits can be found:

Be sure your car is registered to the address first and have all t45     he information about your car handy.  If the car is not in your name, you will need to get a signed 46     letter from the owner granting you permission to use it.  It's better to have the car in your name. -1      Life will be easier.
