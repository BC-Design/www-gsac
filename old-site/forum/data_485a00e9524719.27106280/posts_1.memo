-1                                                                                                          2      I was wondering what the deal was with access to the athletic facilities?  Do we have to pay or does3       the school cover it?  If we have to pay, how much is it and how are the facilities?

And I wish I s-1     pelled access correctly in the subject title.....                                                   5      membership to the recreational sports facility, rsf, is $10/semester.  The department covers all man6      datory fees, so the rsf fee is not covered by the department, and is typically paid through your car7      s account. (more info: http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/gsac/grad_info/pay_benefits/CARS.html)

The fac8      ilities are ok to bad.  I've definitely seen better, but for $10/semester, you're not going to find -1     a better deal.

The rsf website is http://www.recsports.berkeley.edu/                               -1     is CHEM ENGR 270 offered fall 2008? What's the grad class number for biochem engr?                  11     The schedule for classes is here:

So I'm going to go wit12     h no on ChE 270, and therefore no biochemical engineering grad class this term. The undergrad class 13     is offered (ChE170), which Jerome is GSIing. So you can email him at jerome678@aol.com with question14     s about that if you'd like.

If you are looking for a bio-friendly elective, I'd check out the bioen-1     gineering, molecular and cell biology, or chemistry departments for courses.
