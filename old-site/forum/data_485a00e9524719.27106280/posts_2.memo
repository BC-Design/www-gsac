-1                                                                                                          2      I'm an entering first year and I actually did have a question about the elective we are supposed to 3      choose soon.  The department hasn't really given us much information about what we should be choosin-1     g  - any thoughts?                                                                                  5      Most students either take [b]ChE 170[/b] (bio) or [b]ChE 178[/b] (polymers) since those will satisfy6       the chemical engineering elective requirements toward a PhD.  [url]http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/gs7      ac/grad_info/classes.html#whattotake[/url]

Both courses are fairly easy since they are for undergra8      ds.
Another option this fall is for you to take [b]ChE 246[/b] (also counts toward the elective requ9      irements) which is the electrochemistry course taught by Prof. Newman.

If you are concerned with co10     urses being too easy (who knows), you can sign up for 246, or talk to Joanna MacKay if you're into m11     amallian bio, or Dana Nadler if you're into biofuels/ metabolic engineering bio to see what other co12     urses are available.  I heard that you might be interested in bio(?).  

If you'd like information o13     n other science electives, let us know of your area of interest, and we'll get you in contact with s14     omeone who can give you detailed info.  There are common classes that people in catalysis, polymers,15      NMR groups etc take, so they can help you out.

Moving to the less well-known elective options--

I16     'll also make a plug for looking into the 
[b]Management of Technology[/b] (MOT) certificate and its17      courses
[url]http://mot.berkeley.edu/Berkeley_Students/Students/Courses/Semester_Courses/FL08.html[18     /url]
at Haas Business school or the 
[b]Product Development Program[/b] (PDP) 
[url]http://cheme.be19     rkeley.edu/PDP/overview.html[/url]
(you might notice a PDP course also listed with the MOT courses u20     nder "related courses" as "Intro to New Product Development.")

You can get a certificate in MOT, PD21     P, or DE (more on this soon) and those classes that you take to do so will also count toward your [b22     ]minor requirement[/b].  
[url]http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/gsac/grad_info/classes.html#examplemino23     rs [/url]
(note: MOT, PDP, and DE all satisfy the minor requirements.  They're not listed on our web24     site yet, but Prof. Newman and I recently double checked the gradate student handbook).

In terms of25      going through with the MOT certificate, if you're able to get into a core course, they're nice to g26     et out of the way (as those fill up quickly).  However, if there's a particular related course that 27     strikes your fancy, I'd sign up for it since they're not necessarily offered multiple times.  As for28      professors, Andrew Isaacs and Henry Chesbrough seemed fairly well-liked; their general classes (can29     't speak for the specialty ones that will dive more into Silicon Valley style topics since I didn't 30     take them) were pretty good.

In addition, you could select courses that count toward a scientific [31     b]Designated Emphasis[/b] (DE) which will appear on your transcript and diploma.  There are several 32     DE options, the one I'm most familiar with being the Designated Emphasis in Energy Science Technolog33     y--
[url]http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/deest.html[/url]

Others off the top of my head include (i.e., 34     non-exhaustive list)--
[url]http://computationalbiology.berkeley.edu/application.html[/url]
[url]htt35     p://nano.berkeley.edu/educational/DEGradGroup.html[/url]
[url]http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Gradadm/D36     E.htm[/url]

There doesn't appear to be a centralized location in which these DEs are listed, but if37      you do a google search for "designated emphasis berkeley" and whatever topic you might be intereste38     d in, it might pop up.

Good luck.  If all else fails, remember that you can take a class just for f-1     un (PE, languages, etc) every once in a while too :) .                                              40     wow penny, nice work. thanks for dropping my name too. it sounds like am an authority on something. -1     :D                                                                                                  42     I was thinking about taking a Mat Sci class, Polymer Surfaces and Interfaces...is that a terrible id-1     ea? I'm not trying to kill myself right off the bat.                                                44     According to my roommate who's in mat sci--
jy: "Sounds like a Ting Xu class; shouldn't be too bad.45       I feel like she'd actually put time into her classes.  I don't know about her teaching too much th46     ough because she's new.  If she is teaching, I think it's like her third class."
hpg: "So do you th47     ink it'd be hard?"
jy: "I don't think so.  Besides, if it's too hard, you can always drop."

She 48     makes a good point; since it is a graduate course, it probably won't fill up.  You can either go ahe49     ad and enroll and drop, or sit in on a few sessions, then choose to add.
In general, it never hurts-1      to listen to Smokey's momma--
[url]http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=bb882c13e5[/url]           51     I must say I love Ting Xu, she is my adviser crush.

I took a class with her last year in the Mat 52     Sci dept (Polymer Physics) and it was awesome.  The class should be relatively small and intimate...53      and she caters very well to grad students.  Last year, I had to miss many classes for experimental 54     trips or conferences, and she was completely fine with it.  The final exam was very open... basicall55     y a bunch of problems other people had in research, and how we would solve it.  We had one other mid56     term and one presentation.

Her lecture style can be quite dry, as she tends to teach straight out57      of the book... but ask her any question and she goes on this long tangent that not only completely 58     answers your questions, but also clarifies the whole universe in one single breath.

I, too, am ta-1     king this class in the fall, and looking forward to it.  See you there(?)!

Nis                   60     Thanks for the info, and the advice from Smokey's mama. I'm convinced, now I just have to figure out-1      how/when to register...                                                                            62     I am pretty interested in going for the MOT certificate but it seems like it might be a large time c63     ommitment. Are advisers OK with you taking the classes that you need for the MOT cert while conducti64     ng research? Also, other schools offer similar programs and let you start the certificate and count 65     the classes for your minor but then charge you an arm and a leg for the additional coursework. Is th-1     at the case at Berkeley or is the whole thing covered while you are a graduate student? Thanks!     67     Are the book titles and editions on the bookstore website usually accurate for what's required for c-1     lasses, or is it better to contact profs/wait til classes start?                                    69     My experience is that the book listings are accurate, however, you might want to wait until classes 70     start to get books because you might be able to borrow one or they could be rarely used in the class71     .

I guess you could always return them for a full refund at most local bookstores within two weeks -1     of the semester.                                                                                    73     Thanks. This could be a stupid question, but I went to undergrad in the boonies so humor me - are th74     ere actually a lot of bookstores around where you can get text books or do you mostly have to stick -1     to the Cal Bookstore?                                                                               76     The used book prices at the bookstore are actually pretty good (compared to half.com and the used bo77     oks on Amazon). I highly recommend borrowing books though, especially if it's a subject you won't be78      using much in your research. There are a couple of local bookstores that sell some textbooks, but I-1      can't say I've used them.                                                                          80     The MOT certificate is free and upon completion of the courses; you merely go to
[url]http://https:/81     /sis.berkeley.edu/motapp/secure/application[/url]
and fill out the form.  Certificates are processed82      in January and June of every year.  Regarding other opportunities, there are also some fellowships 83     available through MOT--

If you wish to take Haas courses that are not part of MOT (accounting, finance, tradi85     tional marketing etc), it is possible for engineering students to request in person a list of course86     s from the Haas administrative office (I believe on the 2nd floor of Cheit Hall).  You will not be a87     ble to register for the course before hand, but may sit-in, and in the event that there are openings88      after the first 2 weeks of classes, you may petition the Haas school to sign up.  

Regarding the t89     ime commitment, obtaining the MOT certificate is not labor intensive.  The certificate only needs 4~90     5 courses (2 Core courses, then 6 units so that can be 2~3 classes), and considering that the depart91     ment requires 3 courses for the minor, this means that you only take 2 extra classes at most in your92      5 years at Berkeley.  The MOT courses are typically good about posting syllabuses and you can judge93      from there how much work a course is going to be.  As a very broad generalization (i.e. there are n94     o doubt exceptions), the courses that are taught by Haas Business school professors or otherwise are95      geared more toward business students will be easier.  Keep in mind that business students are comin96     g back to school after being in the workforce and aren't going to be as interested in spending their97      nights doing homework.  The point of business school, and professors will tell you this as well, is98      more about networking.

More traditional business courses within the MOT program will involve going99      over case studies (short stories that outline a situation that a business faced, some facts, charts100    , and figures.  At the end, you will think about either what move a company should make or what went101     wrong).  There is also a good chance of there being a group project in the form of a paper and perh102    aps presentation.  Overall, the MOT courses are likely to be less of a commitment than typical engin103    eering courses, and a very good way for engineering students to become accustomed to business jargon104     (remember to speak of pies and blue oceans) and discover that business is not nearly as daunting as-1      some may think it to be.                                                                           106    I noticed that ChE 170 is being held during our thermo class.  So, that one seems out. 

I'm inter107    ested in courses that will prepare me to work on protein production, metabolic engineering, biologic108    al control, bioreactor engineering, etc.  I've taken genetics, biochemistry, molecular genetics, int109    ro to bioreactor engineering, bioseparations, and have about 1 1/2 years of experience doing protein110     production with E. coli.  

Does anyone in the Keasling or Schaffer labs have any suggestions on 111    bio electives we should take?  Anything you feel would have been helpful going into their labs?  Any-1     thing you wish you would have taken?                                                                113    you could check if ChE249 is offered, though i think it's offered in the spring.  it's the grad vers114    ion of 170 and Blanch taught it last.  you could also try and see if Keasling is offering any classe115    s (usually he does Synethic Bio in the spring).  you could also try to get some minor requirements o-1     ut of the way and take some BioEng or Bio classes instead.
