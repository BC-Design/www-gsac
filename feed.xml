				<title>Chemical Engineering Department 2009 Holiday Party Announced</title>
				<description>Save the date!  On Friday, December 4th, GSAC and the ChemE Department would like to invite you and your family to a holiday party in 775 Tan Hall at 5 pm. We will have lots of heavy hors d'oeuvres and drinks. We ask that you bring your favorite holiday dessert to help us celebrate the season. Also, a $5 donation is greatly appreciated to cover the beverages! Rocio will have a jar on her desk to collect donations before the party. This event is sponsored by the Graduate Assembly. </description>
