Most people should know where to pu3      t their questions/topics. If they start to fill up (which i doubt) we can make more defined topics l-1     ater on.

Any suggestions for changing topics or descriptions?

[img]smilies/w00t.gif[/img]     5      For suggestions about recreation, what would be a good rule of thumb for knowing what to post where?6        Some info on where are good campsites, events of interest (How Berkeley Can you Be, Pride Parade, 7      Green Festivals etc) happen every year etc would be posted on the ChE website, and then organizing r8      ides year to year and the like would be in the forum?

Also, what are your thoughts on posting con9      tact people for various activities/groups that we're involved in?  For example
Triathalon: Kevin Ha10     as  
Running: ___?  
Hockey: Dana Nadler
Rock climbing: Joel Cohen
Getting into trouble: Will Vi11     ning
Tutoring: _several ppl seem involved in this_
Swing dance: Joe Zakzeski
Poetry power hour wi12     th Papa Prau: Paul Albertus
etc

Good heavens there are a lot of smileys

and geebus a lot of them are violent.                                                14     I think we should continue to add content to the website (e.g. recreational activities, such as camp15     ing), but the forum is a great resource for grad students who can't find what they're looking for on16      the website. If replies on the forum are informative enough, we can even put that information onto 17     the website in a more organized way.
Does this seem like an ok approach? A website obviously can't 18     have all information for all grad students, so the forum is a great supplement.

-There is an RSS feed 22     for each "forum" and each "topic"
     -forum rss feeds will list an update when a new topic within23      the forum is created
     -topic rss will list an update when a new post is made in a topic

-Th24     ere is an rss feed for every forum and topic, even if the link is not there (it is not there because25      the feed is blank), but you can access them with http://stage.cchem.berkeley.edu/~gsac/forum/xml.ph26     p?id=2 or http://stage.cchem.berkeley.edu/~gsac/forum/xml.php?id=2&t_id=1 where you have replaced th27     e forum/topic numbers with the ones of interest

-Topics that are hidden to non-registered guests 28     have RSS feeds, but are only accessible when logged in. Thus, your rss reader will not be able to ac29     cess it unless you are logged in at the same time. So, the rss feeds for those private forums are so-1     mewhat useless since you need to come to the site anyways.
 
(hm) can't think of anything else now31     Anyone else get a request from Joe Ting to implement polls on the forum?  I have to admit, I don't s32     ee a good reason to include such a functionality.  For official things (i.e., housing costs etc), th33     e current system seems more reliable, and for unofficial things...no reason to go asking for trouble34      in that fashion both in terms of questionable surveys and responses (people can get pretty feisty, -1     myself included, on surveys).  Ohnonot that again.
