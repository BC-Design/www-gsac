1                                                                                                           2      For those of you who were with me at lunch and noticed my obscene outburst at the handicapped parkin3      g spots along Telegraph, I've hit a small realization of why I was that mad.

I'm not mad that handi4      capped people can get the good parking spots. I'm mad because...

a) If you are handicapped, shouldn5      't you not be driving? Aren't they putting me at a risk of an accident? What does handicapped define6      d as? Mentally deficient? Physical ailment that impedes you're ability to walk 1/4 mile? Driving is 7      a physical experience so why risk more injury. I'd like to find some statistics on what percentage o8      f accidents are caused by handicapped people or if handicapped people are handicapped because of a v9      ehicular accident...

b) What makes a handicapped person less able to pay a couple of dollars for a 10     parking meter? Yes, if you didn't know this, handicapped people don't have feed the meter. They can 11     park FOR FREE in almost any parking meter parking spot, as far as I've observed. How does being hand12     icapped affect your ability to pay for a meter just like any other person?

The ones I know with a h13     andicapped parking permit are for people who drive handicapped people around. Too often do people ta-1     ke advantage of such convenience for those who need it.                                             15     [url]http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/wdc/323692159.html[/url]

I have 2 dogs & I was buying a16      large bag of Pal at Big W and standing inline at the check out.

A woman behind me asked if I had17      a dog.

On impulse, I told her that no, I was starting The Pal Diet again although I probably sho18     uldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened19      in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IV's in both arms.

I 20     told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants21      pockets with Pal nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry & that the food is nu22     tritionally complete so I was going to try it again.

I have to mention here that practically ever23     yone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a guy who was behind her.

Horr24     ified, she asked if I'd ended up in the hospital in that condition because I had been poisoned. I to25     ld her no; it was because I'd been sitting in the street licking my balls and a car hit me.

I tho26     ught one guy was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard as he staggered out the door.-1     

Stupid b*tch...why else would I buy dog food??

 (hm)                                          28     3:00 is the Infinite Hour. It Must Die!

Three o'clock is the worst hour of the workday. Think abo29     ut it:

9: Coming into the office, I'm jazzed. I log in, check my email, read the news, check a bu30     nch of blogs where people who aren't as smart as I think I am rant on and on about how Bush stole Oh31     io and Social Security is going to cause everyone to die at fifty and think that anyone actually car32     es about Dean v. Rosenberg.

10: Coffee! Go out, walk down the street, get a cup, and by the time 33     I get back, it's almost 11, which means...

11: Plan for lunch! Get out the menus I've got in my d34     esk and fantasize about the food I can have at the many reasonably priced, easily-walkable lunch est35     ablishments in downtown San Francisco! After a bit of that, I'm ready for

12: Lunch "hour." An "h36     our" gives you fifteen minutes of leeway on either side. The Lunch Choice Of The Day will probably i37     nvolve Moo Goo Gai Pan or a 2/3 LB Monster Bacon Butter Cheese Human Lard Plus Thickburger, Topped W38     ith Whipped Cream and Deep Fried or (if I'm really unlucky), Subway sandwiches that suck so much eve39     n that alien cyborg Jared Fogle couldn't eat them and lost weight. I go to Subway; it's close.

1:40      Still at lunch "hour." Done with eating, spending time at the table at Subway watching all of the r41     eally hot advertising chicks who would only talk to me if I threatened their mothers with a garrotte42     , and only then if they'd get a new handbag out of the deal.

1:20: Back to the office, time to ch43     eck on the news in case anything happened in the late morning (Hey, Rudy T is quitting the Lakers!).44      Then it's food coma. Sit at my desk clicking the mouse every few seconds to shift between programs,45      trying to make the windows somehow make a pattern as interesting as the screen saver I used to get 46     stoned to back in college when I were supposed to be doing term papers. All that education is gettin47     g a workout now!

2: Still food coma. It's about now that I should probably get some actual "work"48      done. Nothing like some cover sheet composition and printer paper jams to pass the time.

2:30: A49     h, a post-lunch dump with a couple of printouts from ESPN.com. Bliss.

2:45 Oh no.

2:50 Christ,50      no.

2:55: It's almost here, shit. Finally, I get off the toilet just in time for...

3:00 THE 51     INFINITE HOUR. Time grinds to a halt. It's too early to think about leaving, the food is gone from y52     our stomach, you can't leave for a coffee break because you spent so much time on the can earlier an53     d someone would notice.

3:05: Are you kidding? Frantically scan the best-of-craigslist for someth54     ing entertaining, only to find that Craig only updates the damned thing every few weeks.

3:09: Ho55     mestar Runner hasn't updated either, Shit.

3:10:25 Check email. The send/receive button seems to 56     be broken.

3:15-3:20 Fantasize about what the world would be like if 3:00 could just be skipped.57     

3:20:38: Check email. Apparently my penis is too small, and these guys want to help!

3:25: Sta58     rt revenge fantasies. If 3:00 were a person. Shit, it *is* a person. 3:00 is that little pimply-face59     d fuck who *everybody* hated in elementary school; not because he was a nerd (the nerds kicked him o60     ut), but because he was a little bastard. That fuckhead tattled on everyone, made fun of the geeks f61     or their subpar transformers collection, insulted the big guys for having too much earwax, tried to 62     make girls touch his private regions during square dancing, and (to top it off), sucked at kickball.63      He'd be standing there insulting everyone while teams were chosen, and both captains would look at 64     3:00 for five long minutes and eventually embark on a best-of-11 rock-paper-scissors match to see wh65     o would have to take the little fucker. Then he'd kick into double plays, drop the bouncy red balls,66      pick his nose and wipe it on other people, and once he even pooed his pants. At age ten! What an as67     s.

3:30: That rant only lasted five minutes? 3:00 must die.

3:32:41 Check email. Nothing.

368     :35: Think about ambushing 3:00 before the work day tomorrow and kicking the shit out of it. I can s69     ee the headline in the Chronicle: "Anthropomorphized time period assaulted. Suspect busted out of th70     e pen by cheering crowd of cubicle slaves."

3:38:12: Write email, realize I have nothing to say. 71     I swear, hit send/receive, and watch the blue Outlook bar cross the screen.

3:38:18: Hey, that wa72     s fun! I do that five more times.

3:40: Drank three straight cups of water--going back and forth 73     to the cooler is fun!

3:45: Watching the clock on my desktop. Resetting it to atomic time over an74     d over doesn't make it go any faster.

3:48:19: Check email. I qualify for a home loan! Even thoug75     h my name is misspelled!

3:50: Cutting fingernails down to the quick and using the clippings to w76     rite things into my arm. I end up with marks that make me look like a heroin addict who can't get hi77     s shit together.

3:52: Oh, dear God, end this hell now. Somebody post a funny blog entry or let a78      natural disaster strike somewhere or let George Bush say something stupid or anything at all. I hat79     e my computer and I hate my co-workers and if that stupid fuck from Siebel calls again to help me ma80     ximize my sales potential I will hunt down his children and turn them into a poorly done, first-try-81     is-just-for practice taxidermy project.

3:53:01: Check email. That's it, I'm hiring mercenaries, 82     invading Nigeria, and stringing every banker in the place together by the balls, coating them in hon83     ey, and dropping them naked into a polar bear refuge in Siberia.

3:53:09: Check email. Nothing. I84      hate all of my friends.

3:54: The phone rings. It's the guy from Siebel, wanting to "follow up" 85     on a couple of "action items." I'll "action" his "items" right back up his smirking, job-security-ha86     ving ass, until he has to sit backward to attempt to impregnate his wife. I won't even try to explai87     n that one. Figure it out.

3:56: I'm a puddle. I resolve to get hit by a car every day at 2:57 to88      avoid the 3:00 hour.

3:56:01.8: Check email. My dick just gets smaller, apparently.

3:57: I d89     on't even bother praying to God any more. It's obvious He hates me, and invented the human race for 90     his sick sport. Otherwise He would have made the day 23 hours, instead of 24. I pray to Satan instea91     d, offering to become a serial killer and harvest souls for His Dark Majesty if He'll only make the 92     next three minutes go by at any semblance of normal speed.

3:58: Satan doesn't answer. That cheap93      fuck.

3:59: Attempt to pass out. Fail.

3:59:21: Check email. Nothing

3:59:29: Check email.94      Nothing

3:59:31: Open up the clock icon in Windows and watch the second hand go by. I swear the 95     programmers made it like those clocks in elementary school that tick *back* before they tick forward96     . I hate Microsoft. They'd be the first souls I'd harvest for Satan if the Prince of Darkness wasn't97      such a cheap fuck.

4:00: I slump to my desk, exhausted, wrung out from the weeklong hour that ju98     st passed. In celebration, coffee!

4:15: The guy at the coffee place has huge dark circles under 99     his eyes. I wonder what the Infinite Hour did to him?

4:30: Ah, coffee buzz. Peeing all the time 100    because of all the water I drank earlier.

5:00: What? What happened? I've got a few things to do -1     before...

5:30: Quitting time! Off to MUNI and then home. 22 hours until the next Infinite Hour.
